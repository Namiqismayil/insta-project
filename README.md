This project is created for Capital One Challange.

The whole point is to extract JSON data using Instagram API and manipulate it.

Instruction for using this code.

Download the zip and run index.html. Make sure you are running it through the any IDE(for me I use notepad++ and Webstorm) .It should run in localhost. Personally I used WebStrom(because I used that when I was intern) but notepad++ also works(I checked it).
